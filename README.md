# VictoriaUniGradesCalculator

This was just a simple grades calculator for me to use. It was used to track the grades I've gotten as well as my current gpa.

How it was used is that I had a courseList which contained all my courses, from there the program would iterate through the list and ask if I had a grade for it. If I didn't it would be skipped, if I did I would write that grade and then that would be saved to a file.

That file would then be parsed into the gpaCalculator.py which would be used to calculate my current GPA.
